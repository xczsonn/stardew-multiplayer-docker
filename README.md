# Stardew Valley Multiplayer Docker Compose

This project aims to autostart a Stardew Valley Multiplayer Server as easy as possible. Updated for 1.6!

## Notes

- Updating to most recent version requires a rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- Although I'm trying to put out updates, I don't have the time for testing thoroughly, so if you find issues, including
  game updates, please put in an issue request and I will try to help.
- Thanks printfuck for the base code and baolatui for helping with hosting files.

## Setup

### Configuration

Edit the docker-compose.yml with your desired configuration settings. Setting values are quite descriptive as to what
they set.

```

      - "VNC_PASSWORD=insecure"

### Docker-Compose

```
git clone https://github.com/norimicry/stardew-multiplayer-docker.git

docker-compose up
```

## Game Setup

Intially, you have to create or load a game once via VNC or web interface. After that, the Autoload Mod jumps into the
previously loaded game save everytime you restart or rebuild the container. The AutoLoad Mod config file is by default
mounted as a volume, since it keeps the state of the ongoing game save, but you can also copy your existing game save to
the `Saves` volume and define the game save's name in the environment variables. Once started, press the Always On
Hotkey (default F9) to enter server mode.

### VNC

Use a VNC client like `TightVNC` on Windows or plain `vncviewer` on any Linux distribution to connect to the server. You
can modify the VNC Port and IP address and Password in the `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

Localhost:

```
   # Server is only reachable on localhost on port 2342...
   ports:
     - 127.0.0.1:2342:5900
   # ... with the password "insecure"
   environment:
     - VNCPASS=insecure
```

### Web Interface

On port 5900 (mapped to 5902 by default) inside the container is a web interface. This is a bit easier and more
accessible than just the VNC interface. Although you will be asked for the vnc password, I wouldn't recommend exposing
the port to the outside world.

## Accessing the server

- Friends List: Your Steam or GoG friends should be able to see your game and join at will the same way they would
  normally.
- Direct IP: If you want to set a up direct IP access over the internet "Join LAN Game" you need to open (or forward)
  port 24642. Or use Server Port Changer﻿ to choose a different port.Then give people your external IP.
- Invite Code: Invite Code connections are routed through Steam/GoG . I've provided two methods for delivering your
  game's current invite code to players:
  Invite Code Auto Copy/Paste: The server will copy the most up-to-date invite code to the clipboard (on by default in
  the config.json file) whenever it changes. You can then use a macro program of your choice to paste that code into the
  chat service of your choice so that your non-steam friends can always have access to the most up-to-date invite code
  even when you are not there. For your convenience I've included an AutoHotkey script under the Files Tab> Optional
  Files﻿ here on Nexus that you can use. Run the Game Server>Run the AutoHotKey﻿ Script>Open Discord or other chat
  service and click into the chatbox of that service. The current invite code for your game will be pasted and sent
  every two minutes. Do not close the chat window of your chat service or click out of the chat box or it will not work.
  When the game server is turned off it will no longer copy the key so be sure to turn off AutoHotKey as well.
  Invite Code Bot: ﻿The server will copy the invite code to an "InviteCode.txt" file in the same folder as the mod. You
  can use this to make a bot for a chat service/website/etc. I've provided the code for a node.js Discord bot in the "
  Discord Bots" section at the bottom of this page.

## Troubleshooting

### Waiting for Day to End

Check VNC just to make sure the host hasn't gotten stuck on a prompt.

### Error Messages in Console

Usually you should be able to ignore any message there. If the game doesn't start or any errors appear, you should look
for messages like "cannot open display", which would most likely indicate permission errors.

### VNC

Access the game via VNC to initially load or start a pre-generated savegame. You can control the server from there or
edit the config.json files in the configs folder.
